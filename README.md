# Cloud Init Library

A comprehensive collection of cloud-init configurations and scripts designed for system administrators and DevOps engineers managing cloud infrastructure at scale.

## Overview

Cloud-init serves as the de-facto standard for initial system configuration across cloud platforms. This repository provides tested, production-ready configurations for:

- System initialization and bootstrapping
- Network configuration and security hardening
- Package management and service deployment
- Infrastructure automation and compliance
- User management and access control

## Configuration Categories

### System Operations

- **Network Management**: VLAN configuration, routing, firewall rules
- **Storage Configuration**: Volume management, mount points, RAID setup
- **Security Hardening**: SELinux/AppArmor, SSH hardening, system auditing
- **Service Deployment**: Container runtime, monitoring agents, backup systems

### Infrastructure Components

The library supports infrastructure-as-code practices across:

- Multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Container orchestration platforms
- CI/CD integration points
- Configuration management systems

    CloudInit->>Instance: Configure system
    Instance->>User: Ready for use
```

## Quick Start

```yaml
# Example cloud-init configuration
#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true

packages:
  - docker
  - git
  - nginx

runcmd:
  - systemctl start docker
  - systemctl enable docker
```
